The year started with a good news, I received an email from Microsoft saying that I have been selected as an MVP in the web development category.

For those of you who arenâ€™t aware of the term, [Microsoft Most Valued Professionals](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp) is a program by Microsoft to recognize the efforts of technical community members who help in building, creating, advocating, and promoting their products. Unlike any other ambassador program, this program adds weight and can help you in your professional life ahead. Getting in is not easy, and you need to prove your merits/contribution to get selected and also continue contributing to stay an MVP.

In this article, I will share how I became an MVP, and hoping it can help you prepare, if you are planning to become one.

## How do I apply to become an MVP?

You cannot apply to become an MVP. You have to be nominated by an existing MVP or a Microsoft employee to be able to apply to become one.

*If you are interested, you can also DM me with your work on* [*LinkedIn*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haimantika-mitra/) *or* [*X(Twitter)*](https://x.com/HaimantikaM)*.*

### When does the application open?

The MVP application stays open throughout the year. Whenever you are ready, ask your referrer to nominate you.

## What does the process look like?

Once you have been nominated, you will receive an email with links to a portal where you need to submit proof of the different kinds of contributions you have made to the Microsoft community. This could be blogs, videos, GitHub contributions, projects, or even social media posts. You can submit a maximum of 24 contributions under various categories. Along with that, you will need to answer a few questions about your interest in the program and how you plan to contribute in the future. You will have around 45 days to complete this, and you will get the decision within 90 days.

For example, I was nominated on September 24th, 2024, had time until November 7th, 2024, to apply, and heard back from the team on January 1st, 2025.

## What do I get when I become a Microsoft MVP?

There are a LOT of perks that you get as an MVP. Not sharing them all here (letâ€™s save the best for when you get selected ðŸ˜‰)

Here are some of the perks that I love:

* Access to LinkedIn Premium for free for a year.
    
* Discount on Microsoft certification.
    
* The MVP Award kit, the Credly badge, the recommendation letter.
    
* Early access to product releases, invite-only meetups, and Microsoft conferences like Build.
    
* Access to fellow MVPs, Microsoft advocates, and the wider community with an opportunity to build and network with everyone. *(I used to be a Microsoft Student Ambassador, and the network can be very helpful. You not only get friends but also people who can motivate you and help you professionally.)*
    

## Tips to keep in mind while applying:

* Try to contribute to the Microsoft ecosystem for at least a year. If you've been doing it for longer, that's even better. In my case, I worked extensively with Microsoft Power Platform in 2020 and continued through 2021. A few months later, I started working at Microsoft, then moved to different companies, built many projects with web technologies, and refocused on Microsoft technologies in late 2023. I applied for the MVP program in mid-2024.
    
* Even though you can report a maximum of 24 contributions, try to have a few more and keep a list of what you did in a separate sheet for easy tracking.
    
* Keep your contributions paced out throughout the year. Do not try to do a lot of things in a month and then have no activity for months. This is a volunteering role, and what helps is being consistent throughout the year rather than jampacking everything in a month or two.
    
* Try to contribute in multiple areas. Writing blogs might be your forte, but also try to make a social media post out of it, or maybe use this content to help a few folks in the Microsoft forums. While this is not mandatory, it is a good practice and shows that you can contribute in multiple areas.
