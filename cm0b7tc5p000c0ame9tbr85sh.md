Hello and welcome to **The Algorithm**, a weekly tech newsletter where I discuss all things tech. Each week, I cover trending topics, share interesting articles, highlight community events, and provide information about upcoming conferences and more!

**The Algorithm** will be in your inbox every week, so make sure to subscribe (you will still be able to read it without subscribing, but pretty please?).

Starting next week, stay tuned for the freshest tech gossip (just a term) and the hottest trends!

~ Signing off,
