By now, you must have seen chatbots on almost every business website and even forums. With generative AI, the chatbots are now faster and better. You no longer have to worry about outdated information, training your chatbots for a long time, or creating a knowledge base from scratch.

In this article, I will introduce you to Microsoft Copilot and show how you can build a chatbot that fetches data directly from a website.

## What is Microsoft 365 copilot?

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered tool that works with Microsoft 365 apps to help users be more productive and creative. It combines large language models (LLMs) with an organization's data to provide real-time assistance.

It includes features like:

* Chat with text, voice, and image capabilities
    
* Image creation in Designer
    
* Web grounding
    
* Use of plugins and Copilot GPTs
    

## Preparing to build the chatbot

Building the chatbot is fairly easy using the Copilot Studio, and the only prerequisite you need is to have a Microsoft 365 subscription. If you are a developer like me, you can sign up for the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) for free. Along with Copilot Studio access you also get a tonne of other benefits.

So what are we building today? A chatbot that can help you answer banking related queries. For this demo, I have used [State Bank of India](https://sbi.co.in/). Depending on your use case, you can make the required changes.

This is how the information flows ðŸ‘‡

The processed data is then sent to a bot, which generates a response.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717499453831/ce3f2570-e5f2-4d10-a17d-c0309433cc7a.png align="center")

## Steps to build the bot

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Copilot](https://powerva.microsoft.com/) [Studio.](https://powerva.microsoft.com/)
    
2. Click on the `+Create` option from the left pane and choose `New Copilot`. Depending on your use case, you can also start with a template.

Below these options, there are various templates available, including Safe Travels, Store Operations, Sustainability Insights, Website Q&A, Approval Manager, CV Match, Job Craft, Kudos, Wellness Check, and Status Tracker. Some templates are marked as "Coming soon."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717499685863/3fbc1905-1a4b-40fb-a744-30ebb4fe6e5a.png align="center")
    
3. Once you click on `New Copilot`, you get to see a screen as shown in the image below. The click on `Skip to configure` to add details for your chatbot.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Copilot Studio interface. The screen shows a prompt saying, "Hi, Iâ€™m here to help you build a custom copilot. In a few sentences, how will your copilot assist your users?" Below the prompt is a text box labeled "Type your message" with a send button. There are buttons labeled "Skip to configure" and "Create" at the top right. The interface indicates the primary language is English.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717499801415/fac46b77-4a67-455d-8d2a-062b9d1838d1.png align="center")
    
4. Add a name for the copilot, add required description, and instructions and then add the knowledge source. You will get multiple sources as options, but for this demo, choose `Public websites` and add the link to the website that will act as knowledge base for your bot.

It lists various sources such as Public websites, SharePoint and OneDrive, Files, Dataverse, Microsoft Fabric, Enterprise websites, Azure SQL, ADLS Gen2, Salesforce, ServiceNow Knowledge, File share, MediaWiki, and SharePoint Server. There is a "Close" button at the top right and a "Cancel" button at the bottom right.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717499907023/3fb82a77-20d8-409c-be74-5af7f1e449c8.png align="center")
    
5. Once you have filled in all the details, this is how it will look ðŸ‘‡. The click on `Create` to create the conversational chatbot.

6. As a final set before publishing it to various channels, test the bot with various queries and see if it responds correctly.

## Extending your Copilot

Now that we have built a chatbot, let us take it a step ahead, and ask it to collect information such as full name, email address, and phone number. To do that, you need to build a flow. Microsoft Copilot has [Power Automate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-automate) inbuilt and it can be easily done with the help of Copilot.

1. Go to the `Topics` from the menu bar and click on `Add a topic`.
    
2. You have two options: `Create from blank` or `Create a description with Copilot`.
    
3. To make it simple, choose `Create a description with Copilot` and fill in the details such as:
    
    * Name a topic to: `Book a call with an agent`
        
    * Create a topic to:`Collect a user's full name, email, and phone number`
        
4. Then click on `Create` and the topic gets created for you.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Copilot Studio with the topic created](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717500739630/78e4511e-4f3c-4f76-80e2-10b5d645e8e9.png align="center")
    
    You can make more updates such as:
    
    * Updating the trigger phase
        
    * Summarizing the information gathered from the user. You can do this by clicking on the `Copilot` option as shown in the image below.

The main section displays the "SBI helpdesk" topic with options to edit with Copilot, add comments, variables, and more. The right panel includes a chat interface for testing the copilot, with a sample message from the SBI helpdesk virtual assistant.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717501111396/c97f7e6e-fb5e-4e81-a67b-95b79977f23b.png align="center")
