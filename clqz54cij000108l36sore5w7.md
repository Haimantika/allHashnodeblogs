Artificial intelligence has levelled up with large language models like OpenAI's GPT and Llama. These models are driven by vast amounts of data and have the capability to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. However, the accuracy and reliability of these AI giants heavily rely on the quality of data they are trained on. If you have noticed, ChatGPT comes with a disclaimer that say, "*ChatGPT can make mistakes. Consider checking important information*". The model is also said to hallucinate, which means it will make up information that is not true. While LLMs are good at generalizing from the data they've been trained on, they can struggle with overfitting to their training data, leading to poor performance on unseen data or novel tasks. In this blog, we will explore how you can enhance the accuracy of such language models.

## The importance of data quality

At the heart of any AI model, especially language models, lies data. The phrase 'garbage in, garbage out' is particularly relevant here. If the training data is flawed or biased, the AI model will inevitably inherit these flaws. This results in inaccuracies, biases, and at times, unreliable outputs. Hence, ensuring the quality of training data is essential.

## The data quality custodian

This is where [Cleanlab](https://cleanlab.ai/) comes to the rescue. It turns unreliable data into reliable models and insights. It is an advanced suite of tools designed to identify, analyze, and correct flaws in training [datasets](https://help.cleanlab.ai/guide/concepts/datasets/). By leveraging cutting-edge algorithms, Cleanlab Studio can detect inconsistencies, label errors, and anomalies that often go unnoticed. It handles the entire data quality and data-centric AI pipeline in a single framework for analytics and machine learning tasks.

It helps in:

* Finding and fixing label issues
    
* Finding and fixing data issues
    
* Knowing when to trust your data

## Improving model accuracy

Hereâ€™s how [Cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) is contributing to the improvement of language models:

1. **Error Identification and Correction**: It can sift through vast datasets to find labeling errors or inconsistencies. By rectifying these errors, the data becomes more accurate, leading to more precise model training.
    
2. **Bias Reduction**: In AI, bias is a significant concern. Cleanlab Studio helps in identifying and mitigating biases within the data, ensuring that the AI models are more equitable and fair in their responses.
    
3. **Data Efficiency**: It aids in identifying the most informative data points. This means that models can be trained more effectively, using fewer but higher-quality data, speeding up the training process without compromising on output quality.
    
4. **Domain-Specific Training**: For specialized applications, such as legal or medical text analysis, it can help curate domain-specific datasets that enhance the model's accuracy in these fields.
    
5. **Handling Ambiguity**: Language is often ambiguous and open to interpretation. Cleanlab can assist in training these models to better understand and handle linguistic ambiguities, a critical aspect of natural language processing.
    

## Case studies

GPT and Llama are great examples of models that can benefit from Cleanlab Studio. These models are used for tasks like text completion and complex problem-solving, requiring a deep understanding and accurate context.

For instance, OpenAI's GPT-3, with its 175 billion parameters, excels in language comprehension. However, its performance hinges on the quality and accuracy of its training data. Cleanlab Studio ensures that GPT-3 is fed the best data, free from errors or biases, enhancing its reliability and performance.

Similarly, Llama, employed in various tasks such as language translation and content creation, necessitates error-free, unbiased training data. This ensures that Llama's outputs are not only fluent but also precise and culturally respectful.

## Example: Improved sentiment analysis

**Objective**: Improve a sentiment analysis model's accuracy on the [IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) using Cleanlab Studio.

**Steps involved:**

1. **Data Setup**: Use the IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset, split into training and testing sets. Reviews are labeled as 'positive' or 'negative'.
    
2. **Baseline Model**: Train a basic sentiment analysis model. Initial accuracy on the test set: 80%.
    
3. **Cleanlab Analysis**: Apply Cleanlab Studio to identify potential label errors in the training data.
    
4. **Error Correction**: Manually review and correct identified label errors, refining the dataset.
    
5. **Re-training**: Train the model on the refined dataset.
    

**Results**: Improved accuracy on the test set: 87%.

Example: For instance, a review saying, "I loved the unique plot and outstanding acting, but the movie was too long." This review might have been incorrectly labeled as 'negative' due to the presence of a negative phrase, even though the overall sentiment is positive.

**Conclusion**

As we continue to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve, the focus must increasingly shift towards the quality of data. Cleanlab Studio is at the forefront of this shift, ensuring that the future of AI is not only intelligent but also reliable and fair. The journey of AI is an exciting one, and with such tools, we are one step closer to achieving AI models that truly understand and interact with human language in a meaningful way.
